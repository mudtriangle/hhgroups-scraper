# Web Scraping Tool for HHGroups Website
This tool was developed to extract the lyrics from rap songs stored in HHGroups, the largest collection of Rap music in
Spanish. Written in Python 3.8, using Docker, Scrapy, and BeautifulSoup.

## Relevance
There are a few datasets out there that deal with data extracted from this website. However, I have found that in my
personal experience they are not necessarily well thought out, with incorrectly formatted data or other contents from
the website that are not necessarily song lyrics.\
Furthermore, as the exploration of NLP tools increase, it becomes increasingly relevant to be able to extract written
content in languages other than English (Spanish, in this case).
